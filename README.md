**Authors:** Alaa Radwan, Tshegofatso Tswai

## Overview

The Simple Shell Project is a basic command-line shell designed as a coding exercise. It is capable of executing commands, managing aliases, handling variables, and performing fundamental shell operations. The shell is versatile and can be used interactively or to run commands from a file.

## Project Files

The project comprises the following essential files:

- **main.c:** This file serves as the primary entry point for the shell program. It determines whether to operate in interactive mode or execute commands from a file.
- **AUTHORS:** This file lists the contributors and authors who contributed to the project.
- **alias.c:** Contains functionality related to handling aliases in the shell.
- **builtin.c:** Provides implementations of various built-in shell commands.
- **builtin_a.c:** Additional file containing built-in command implementations.
- **builtin_b.c:** Another file containing built-in command implementations.
- **env_file.c:** Handles environmental file operations.
- **environ.c:** Manages environment-related functions.
- **err_msgs_a.c:** Stores error messages used in the shell.
- **err_msgs_b.c:** Additional error messages.
- **errors.c:** Contains functions for handling errors in the shell.
- **getline.c:** Implements custom getline functionality for reading input.
- **getline_def.h:** Header file for getline functions.
- **handle_file.c:** Manages file-related operations in the shell.
- **handle_list.c:** Handles lists of items in the shell.
- **helpers_a.c:** Contains various helper functions used in the shell.
- **helpers_b.c:** Additional helper functions.
- **inp_helpers.c:** Provides input-related helper functions.
- **local_check:** An executable file.
- **locate.c:** Implements locating functionality.
- **root.h:** Header file.
- **shell:** Shell executable.
- **split.c:** Contains functions for splitting strings.
- **string_a.c:** Functions related to string manipulation.
- **string_b.c:** Additional string manipulation functions.
- **strtools.h:** Header file for string-related functions.
