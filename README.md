# Simple Shell Project

**Authors:** Alaa Radwan, Tshegofatso Tswai

## Overview

This is a simple shell project developed as part of a coding exercise. The project aims to create a basic command-line shell that can execute commands, handle aliases, variables, and basic shell operations. The shell can be used both interactively and to run commands from a file.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into four files:

- `main.c`: Contains the main entry point of the shell program, which determines whether to run in interactive mode or execute commands from a file.
- `AUTHORS`: Where the list of the individuals who worked in the project are located.
- `shell.c` and `shell.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
